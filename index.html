      <img src="assets/images/me and boys.jpg" class="auth-image" alt="Tristen Sr">

      <p>My name is Tristen Ford Sr., and I have been working in the IT Industry for the past 8 years, and currently on contract with Cubic Global Defesne as their Sr. IT Specialist.</p>

      <p>Originally I'm from Arkansas, so if the Razorbacks beat any Florida team to me it naturally feels like an championship (and no the sport doens't matter).</p>

      <p>My spare time is taken up by my 2 sons, in which our love for basketball ball helped start a small but effective basketball training program called "Aspire 2 Be Training".</p>

      <p>Completing the UCF Coding Bootcamp is a stepping stone to become more versatile in my current IT career and to begin to create more oppurtunities for myself personally and professionally.</p>
